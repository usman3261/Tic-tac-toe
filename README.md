Tic Tac Toe

A simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focuses on clean code structure using factory functions and the module pattern, with minimal global code.

ðŸš€ Features

Modular code structure using factory functions and IIFEs

Game logic fully functional in the console before adding DOM interaction

DOM rendering of the gameboard with interactive UI

Player input, restart button, and game result display

ðŸ§  Project Structure

Gameboard Module: Stores the game state as an array and handles gameboard-specific logic.

Player Factory: Creates player objects with names and markers.

Game Controller: Manages turn-taking, win checking, and game flow.

Display Controller: Handles all DOM interactions and rendering.

ðŸ›  Development Approach

Set up the project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Write core game logic using objects and factory functions.

Ensure the game works entirely through the console:

Check for win/tie conditions

Call functions manually to simulate gameplay

Create a Display Controller to render the board and interact with players.

Add UI elements:

Player name inputs

Start/Restart button

Game result display
